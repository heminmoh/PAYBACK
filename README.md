# PAYBACK Android Coding Challenge



First, thank you for your consideration,
The code challenge has been Done and I send you the result.

## Attributes

## Software architectural pattern :  MVVM architecture 
## Components: Coroutine,AsyncTask,Retrofit 2.0 ,LiveData,Android Navigation Component,Dagger 2, Picasso, ...
## Tests :  Unit-Test for some functions
## All data in requests cached
## Design Pattens: Singelton, Repository,Adapter

After receiving the coding challenge information, I preferred to be aware about the coding challenge needs and requests. Without a doubt, every project has both requested and non-requested requirements and I tried to consider these issues. MVVM architectural design pattern chooses to implement software. After, I analyzed the API information and objects. Consequently, I designed the models based on data type and attributes.     

After that, I provided a method to access data using Coroutines as a concurrency design pattern with the main approach to execute asynchronously and I received your API data and put it in the object. I used the Dagger 2 as the dependency injection framework and Android Navigation Component to navigate between fragments.

Based on the MVVM structure I designed models, ViewModels, and finally, I used the databinding to bind layouts and UI components to data sources . To better control different aspects of the project, I decided to classify all methods and functions in some packages including remote, models, activities, adapter, utilities, â€¦. I tried to follow the Loose Coupling and SOLID Object-Oriented Design principles in implementation.

In the last step, I wrote some Unit tests for the project.


I can explain the activities which I did on code in the future.


Hope to meet your expectations.

Best,
Abdulah Mohamadian
